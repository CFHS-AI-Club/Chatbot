# AI Club Chatbot Project 

Here's what we're going to do:

1. Check out Gemini's API documentation to understand how it works. 
2. Start simple: create a chatbot that can have a basic conversation with you.

Remember:
- Begin with easy interactions. As you get more comfortable, try adding more complex features.
- Share your progress, any challenges you face, and how you solve them.

Goal:
We'll present our chatbots at the next meet-up, highlighting your development journey and insights.

Happy coding!
